It's an encapsulation of  In-App Purchase (StoreKit) APIs.

To use this in your project, just build this and add XLInAppPurchase.framework to your project.

There's 2 ways to implement XLInAppPurchase manager:
1. Initialize XLInAppPurchaseManager with -initWithProductIdentifier:delegate:loadStore:enableNotifications:. Start purchase by calling -makePurchase;
2. Initialize XLInAppPurchaseManager with -initWithProductIdentifier:. Then call -loadStore to load store. Start purchase by calling -makePurchase;
